# Gibrish-to-Hebrew
This program transform badly encoded hebrew text especially in subtitles back to readable hebrew

As a native Hebrew speaker I download subtitles from time to time to watch movies and Tv shows.
When you download subtitle in Hebrew in an English based Windows operating system sometimes you will encounter a badly encoded file of subtitles that every Hebrew character is shown as non readable characters.

For example:

![Gibrish subtitle](https://github.com/itaibenjy/Gibrish-to-Hebrew/blob/master/gibrish.png)

This program that was build with python and tkinter will let you choose a specific file and transform it from a non readable characters to Hebrew:

The end result will look like this:

![Hebrew subtitle](https://github.com/itaibenjy/Gibrish-to-Hebrew/blob/master/hebrew.png)

I uploaded here the source file and and executable for anyone to use.
